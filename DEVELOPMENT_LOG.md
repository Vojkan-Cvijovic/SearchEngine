# Development Log - Search Engine Library

## What's Done ✅
- **Core Library**: Complete text indexing service with concurrent access
- **Filesystem Watching**: Real-time monitoring with automatic index updates  
- **Extensible Tokenization**: Interface-based system for custom tokenization algorithms
- **Thread Safety**: ReadWriteLock-based concurrent operations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in metrics for duration and memory usage
- **Basic Configuration**: Index/watch directory paths via a properties file
- **Retry Mechanism**: Centralized exponential backoff retry utility for critical operations
- **File Type Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of supported extensions and configuration

## Current Status
**81% code coverage** - Core functionality complete with room for more tests
** Unit tests** - Some tests require more polish and edge case coverage
**Documentation** - Basic usage documented, advanced features pending
**Performance** - Handles moderate datasets well, needs tuning for large-scale use
**Retry Logic** - Implemented on key operations, can be expanded further

## Future Work Ideas 🚀

### Configuration & Tuning
- **Multiple Watch Directories**: Allow watching multiple folders simultaneously
- **File Type Filters**: Configurable file extensions to watch/index
- **Memory Tuning**: Configurable index size, right now index will grow without any control, LRU eviction, memory monitoring, configurable limits
- **Thread Pool Sizing**: Adjustable thread counts for indexing/watching
- **Batch Processing**: Configurable batch sizes for bulk operations
- **Index Persistence**: Save/load indexes to/from disk, incremental updates, recovery

### Search Features
- **Result Ranking**: TF-IDF scoring, relevance algorithms, boolean queries, result pagination
- **Advanced Queries**: Boolean operators, phrase search, wildcards
- **Search History**: Cache recent searches and results
- **Result Pagination**: Handle large result sets efficiently

### Performance & Scalability
- **Background Indexing**: Non-blocking index updates
- **Compression**: Reduce memory footprint for large datasets
- **Lazy Loading**: Load file content only when needed
