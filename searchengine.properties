# Search Engine Configuration File
# 
# This file configures the directories used by the Search Engine application.
# Modify the paths below to match your desired directory structure.
#
# The application will:
# 1. Store search indexes in the index.directory
# 2. Watch for file changes in the watch.directory
#
# If this file is not found or contains invalid values, the application
# will use default directories in your home folder.

# Directory where search indexes will be stored
# Example: /Users/username/Documents/SearchIndex
# Example: C:\Users\username\Documents\SearchIndex
index.directory=/Users/vojkan.cvijovic/Workspace/SearchEngine

# Directory to watch for file changes
# Example: /Users/username/Documents/WatchFolder
# Example: C:\Users\username\Documents\WatchFolder
watch.directory=/Users/vojkan.cvijovic/Workspace/SearchEngine/src

# Note: 
# - Use absolute paths for best results
# - Ensure the directories exist or have write permissions
# - The watch directory will be created automatically if it doesn't exist
# - Both properties are REQUIRED - the application will not start without them
